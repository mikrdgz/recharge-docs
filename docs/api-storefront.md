# Storefront

ReCharge provides the capabilities to present your customers with subscription options on your website via our JavaScript SDK.  The SDK gives you full access to all your product’s subscription options via a CDN script embedded in your webpage. You can then create elements on store pages such as a subscription widget on the product page, logic to determine if subscriptions are in the customer’s cart and more. 

## CDN

We provide you with a CDN URL that lets you retrieve all ReCharge product data client-side. This is a powerful tool and can speed up your development process eliminating the need to create a data layer to interact with product information as customers interact with your storefront.

### Setup

Add the CDN script to needed pages. If you're using a frontend templating engine, adding it to the base HTML file is a good idea. We will provide you with a unique store hash you will add to the script URL.

`<script src="https://platform-data-prod.rechargeadapter.com/<STORE_HASH>/<STORE_HASH>-data.js"></script>`


## ReCharge data object

Once you've made the CDN URL available on desired pages, you will have access to the `RCA_DATA` object that contains three child objects:

- `RCA_FILE_DATA`
- `RCA_STORE_DATA`
- `RCA_PRODUCT_DATA`

The `RCA_FILE_DATA` and `RCA_STORE_DATA` objects contain meta information about the script itself and your store. You'll mainly target the `RCA_PRODUCT_DATA` array which contains information about products in the store. You can surface this information on the storefront in ways you see fit. 

### Example `RCA_DATA` object

```json
{
  "RCA_FILE_DATA": {

    "hash": "<store_hash>",
    "weight_units": ""
  },
  "RCA_PRODUCT_DATA": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "weight": null,

          ]
        }
      ],
