# Customer Portal

You'll find the ReCharge Customer Portal linked from a customer's account page. A link titled **Manage Subscriptions** will appear on the Account page if the customer has subscription orders. This will work out of the box. We recommend waiting to build a customized Customer Portal until your subscription program grows in size.
