# Addresses 
## What are Addresses?
Addresses represent one of the many shipping locations a customer can have. An address is created when a shopper purchases a subscription. [Subscriptions](https://developer.rechargepayments.com/#subscriptions) are tied to a given address. Each customer can have multiple address objects in a many-to-one relationship. Some use cases for this endpoint are to update customer billing information or overriding a Shopify shipping rate.

> Customers can subscribe to the same product multiple times as long as they use a different address.
