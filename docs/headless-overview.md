# Headless Overview

ReCharge offers APIs and developer tools that let you bring subscription functionality to the site or ecommerce platform of your choice. Use our subscription engine anywhere and seamlessly incorporate ReCharge with the rest of your ecommerce tech stack.

> ### Note
> Significant custom development is required to headlessly integrate ReCharge.

## Recommmended best practices

### Frontend
We recommend using our CDN JavaScript frontend approach with BigCommerce. To get started, see [BigCommerce Overview]().
If you're building your own frontend, refer to the [Expected Frontend Functionality]() article to ensure your CSS elements 

### Customer Portal
We recommend using our hosted [Customer Portal](https://support.rechargepayments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008683274-Customer-portal-) to allow customers to manage their subscriptions. This tech stack is a fast solution to getting started with headless. Building your own customer account functionality is only necessary if you require a very custom build. We recommend waiting to build a custom Customer Portal until your subscription program is proven and you see sustained customer growth.

### Checkout 
We recommend handing off order data to the ReCharge [hosted checkout](https://support.rechargepayments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008682954-Customizing-the-ReCharge-checkout) as it's proven at scale with high conversion. If you chose to create your own checkout flow, you're responsible for keeping customer information secure and [PCI Compliance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). Our checkout can be customized to match the look and feel of your storefront, and we integrate with many major tax and shipping apps. 

## Setting up a store
ReCharge doesn't have store management APIs, so you will need to setup all of your store's settings in the Control Panel.
