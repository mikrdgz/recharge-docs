# Headless Storefront

You may choose to integrate headlessly with ReCharge to use our subscription features on an unsupported ecommerce platform. Using this method you can use our subscription enginer paired with a custom site or open-source ecommerce. This article will cover high-level considerations for integrating ReCharge subscriptions with your own custom frontend. 



## Middleware

You will need to make API calls from your own server to retrieve products, customer and subscription data. We currently only provide JavaScript functions via CDN with our BigCommerce integration, but plan to support site-agnostic CDN functions in the future.
