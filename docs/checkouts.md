# Checkouts
## What is a Checkout?
You can use checkouts when creating subscription orders via headless stores. You can `POST` a checkout and create all the information needed to process an order at once. Each of the API resources are updated as a customer goes through the out-of-the-box ReCharge order workflow, but you can use the Checkouts resource to send all of this data to ReCharge in one call.
