# ReCharge Hosted Checkout


Create a checkout experience for customers directing to ReCharge’s hosted checkout by using Recharge’s checkout API. This is the recommended checkout method when using ReCharge headlessly. The ReCharge-hosted Checkout presents an interface allowing you to process checkouts that will sync into the ReCharge system.  

There are 2 main steps to process checkouts via the ReCharge-Hosted Checkout:

## 1. Sending a Checkout to ReCharge
When a user clicks the checkout button on the storefront (or any action that triggers the checkout process is taken), you will call your middleware to build the checkout object.  You will `POST` your cart contents (or custom-built line items) to the ReCharge checkout endpoint, along with any miscellaneous properties (ex. utm parameters, discount code, etc.).

### Example POST to /checkouts

```json
{
  "line_items": [
    {
      "charge_interval_frequency": 5,
      "cutoff_day_of_month": None,
      "cutoff_day_of_week": None,
      "expire_after_specific_number_of_charges": None,
      "fulfillment_service": "manual",
      "order_day_of_month": None,
      "order_day_of_week": None,
      "order_interval_frequency": 5,
      "order_interval_unit": "day",
      "product_id": <product_id>,
      "quantity": 6,
      "requires_shipping": True,
      "taxable": True,
      "variant_id": <variant_id>,
    }
  ],
}
```

## 2. Redirect customer to ReCharge
Once you've created the checkout, you will receive a *token* in the response. Send the token in a redirect URI, which will take the customer back to ReCharge and allow them to complete the transaction. 

### Example redirect URI
