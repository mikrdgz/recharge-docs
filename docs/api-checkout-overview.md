# API Checkout Overview

## The checkout experience
You can fully customize the checkout experience when customers purchase a ReCharge subscription product. Seamlessly integrate ReCharge with your current ecommerce checkout using our APIs and existing checkout tool. 

## Recommendation
We recommend using the [ReCharge hosted checkout](docs/recharge-hosted-checkout.md) as its proven at scale for conversion and is fully [PCI compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). This solution involves minimal API calls, and simply leverages the same solution used in our turnkey integration. If you choose to create your own external checkout, you're responsible for securing customer payment information. 

## Third-party and self-hosted checkouts
ReCharge offers the [Checkout API](https://developer.rechargepayments.com/#checkouts) which you can use to create a fully self-hosted checkout. This approach allows you to control the look and feel of the checkout, and customize the checkout flow. This approach is recommended if you are trying to achieve a highly branded checkout experience.

If you've already built and managed a checkout, you can create a third-party checkout experience and create customer, address and subcription information after the checkout process is complete. Using this approach, you will handle the checkout process and ReCharge will only receive subscription purchase information.
