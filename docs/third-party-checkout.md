## Third-Party Checkout
This article will walk you through the steps for creating your own third-party checkout. This approach is the most customizable option for checking out customers with the ReCharge API integration and lets you own the entire process outside of ReCharge's system.

## 1. Create customer
Using this checkout workflow, you will handle moving the customer through checkout **first**, then send data gathered during the checkout process to ReCharge.

The first step is creating a customer using the [Customers](https://developer.rechargepayments.com/#customers) API endpoint. When creating a customer, the following fields are required:
- Name
- Email 
- Billing address
- Vaulted payment processor token

### Example create customer

`POST` to `/customers`

```json
{
  "email": "example_mail@gmail.com",
  "billing_address1": "3030 Nebraska Avenue",
  "billing_city": "Los Angeles",
  "billing_country": "United States",
  "billing_first_name": "John",
  "billing_last_name": "Smith",
  "billing_phone": "1234567890",
  "billing_province": "California",
  "billing_zip": "90404",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "stripe_customer_token": "<customer_payment_token>"
}
```

Your application can also retrieve an existing customer if they've made a previous purchase.


## 2. Create shipping address

The next step is creating the shipping address in ReCharge that's tied to the customer's subscription delivery. If you created a new customer in the last step, you should have received an `id` in the callback. You will pass the customer `id` as part of the request URL.

### Example create shipping address

`POST` to `/customers/:id/addresses`

```json
{
  "address1": "1776 Washington Street",
  "city": "Los Angeles",
  "company": "ReCharge",
  "country": "United States",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "phone": "5551234567",
  "province": "California",
  "shipping_lines_override",
  "zip": "90404",
}

```

## 3. Create subscription

The final step is creating a [Subscription](https://developer.rechargepayments.com/#create-a-subscription) in ReCharge. The subscription record contains information about when the customer gets billed, how often the item is shipped, and the date a customer is charged.

### Example create subscription

`POST` to `/subscriptions`

```json
{
  "address_id": <address_id>,
  "charge_interval_frequency":"30",
  "next_charge_scheduled_at":"2021-02-10",
  "order_interval_frequency":"30",
  "order_interval_unit":"day",
  "quantity":3,
  "Shopify_variant_id": <product_id>
}
```
